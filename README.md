# SpringCS4760P1

This is my readme for Project 1.
Running "make" will compile my project.

Working commands:
./master
./master -h
./master -s x
./master -s i
./master -t
./master -t time

Any combination of the above will run in the command line, with some sort of output.
These will produce the basic functions that they are supposed to. [-s x] will display the default maximum number of children processes allowed. [-s i] will make the program for some children. [-t time] will display the default maximum time that the program is allowed to run. [-h] will give a helpful output to assist the user.
